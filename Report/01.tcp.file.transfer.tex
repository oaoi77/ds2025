\section{Design Protocol}

We create a socket (communication endpoint) using the \texttt{socket()} function for both the client and the server. This enables them to exchange data using IP addresses.

\subsection{Client Side}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{SERVER\_IP} and \texttt{SERVER\_PORT} are defined as the target server's IP address and port number, respectively.
    \item The \texttt{connect()} function is then used to establish a connection between the client and the server.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{connect()} function sends a \textbf{SYN} packet to the server and waits for the server to send back a \textbf{SYN-ACK} packet.
        \item Once the \textbf{SYN-ACK} is received, the client sends an \textbf{ACK} packet to complete the connection establishment process.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Once the connection is established, the client transfers the file to the server using the \texttt{send()} function.
    \item The client reads data from the file in chunks and sends it over the established connection.
    \item Finally, the \texttt{close()} function is used to terminate the communication.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server Side}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{PORT} number is defined on which the server will listen for incoming requests.
    \item The \texttt{listen()} function is used to transition the server socket to passive mode, enabling it to wait for connection requests sent by the client (via \texttt{connect()}).
    \item When the server receives a \textbf{SYN} packet from the client:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The server's TCP stack automatically sends a \textbf{SYN-ACK} packet back to the client.
        \item The server transitions to the \textbf{SYN\_RECEIVED} state while waiting for the client's \textbf{ACK} response.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Once the client sends the \textbf{ACK}, the connection is established.
    \item The \texttt{accept()} function is called to return a new socket dedicated to the established connection.
    \item At this point, the client and server can exchange data.
    \item The server uses the \texttt{recv()} function to receive data sent by the client.
    \item The received data is then written to a file using the \texttt{fprintf()} function.
    \item After all the data has been written to the file, the server socket is closed using the \texttt{close()} function.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture}

The system consists of a server and a client, which communicate with each other using a stream socket. A stream socket allows processes to utilize the \textbf{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)} for communication. Since TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it requires a connection to be established before data can be transferred. The responsibilities of each component are as follows:

\subsection*{Client}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sends a \textbf{SYN} request to initiate the connection.
    \item Receives a \textbf{SYN-ACK} response from the server and then sends an \textbf{ACK} to complete the handshake.
    \item Once the connection is established, the client sends a file to the server.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Server}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Listens for incoming connection requests.
    \item Receives the \textbf{SYN} request from the client and responds with a \textbf{SYN-ACK} packet.
    \item Receives the client's \textbf{ACK} to complete the connection establishment.
    \item After the connection is established, the server receives the file from the client and writes the data to a file.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{send\_file() Function in the client side}

The \texttt{send\_file()} function is responsible for sending a file from the client to the server. It reads the file in chunks and transmits each chunk to the server over an established socket connection.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={send\_file() Function in the Client Side}, label={lst:send_file}]
void send_file(FILE *fp, int client_socket) {
    int n;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    while(fgets(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, fp) != NULL) {
        if(send(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0) == -1) {
            perror("[-] Sending file failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
        bzero(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{recv\_file() Function in the server side}

The \texttt{recv\_file()} function is responsible for receiving a file sent by the client. It reads data from the client socket in chunks, writes the received data into a file, and continues until the connection is closed or an error occurs.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={recv\_file() Function in the Server Side}, label={lst:recv_file}]
void recv_file(int client_socket) {
    int n;
    FILE *fp;
    char *fn = "message.txt";
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    fp = fopen(fn, "w");
    // Loop until the connection is closed or an error occurs
    while (1) {
        // recv() returns the number of bytes read
        n = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
        if (n <= 0) {
            break;
        }
        // Write the received data to message.txt
        fprintf(fp, "%s", buffer);
        bzero(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE); // Clear all data in the buffer
    }
    fclose(fp);
}
\end{lstlisting}
